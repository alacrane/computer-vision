# Real-Time Image Segmentation with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates real-time image segmentation using the YOLOv8 nano model (`yolov8n-seg.pt`) from Ultralytics. It processes video input frame by frame, applies segmentation, displays performance metrics (FPS), and provides a simple interface for user interaction.
